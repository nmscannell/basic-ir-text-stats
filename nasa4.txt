Continuous Monitoring: 24/7/365

The Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) at Johnson Space Center (JSC) supports human exploration by keeping
crew members within acceptable levels of risk from space radiation. This includes continuous solar radiation
environmental monitoring and manned spaceflight operations support 24 hours every day. In addition, SRAG also
provides evaluation of radiological safety with respect to exposure to isotopes and radiation producing
equipment carried on the spacecraft.

Another method of monitoring utilizes dosimeters, sometimes in the form of badges worn by the crewmembers.
These dosimeters measure radiation and are returned to the ground for analysis. The SRAG Space Radiation
Dosimetry Laboratory maintains state-of-the-art analysis systems for multiple types of dosimeters including:
thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), optically stimulated dosimeters (OSLDs), and plastic nuclear track detectors
(PNTDs). All preflight assembly and postflight analysis of the dosimeters are conducted in the lab and the SRAG
team supports training sessions to familiarize the crew with the equipment.

Technology and Hardware used for monitoring and assessing radiation include:

    Time-resolved models of the Earth's magnetic field
    Maps of the radiation fluxes trapped in the geomagnetic-sphere
    Trajectory translator/propagator algorithms
    Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC)
    Charged Particle Directional Spectrometer (CPDS)
    Radiation Area Monitor (RAM)
    Crew Passive Dosimeter (CPD)
