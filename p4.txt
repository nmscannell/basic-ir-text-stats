Conclusion: We present our guidelines defining a text annotation task, along with annotation
results from multiple independently produced annotations, demonstrating the feasibility of the task.
The annotation of a very large corpus of documents along these guidelines is currently ongoing.
These annotations form the basis for the categorization of text along multiple dimensions, to
support viable text mining for experimental results, methodology statements, and other forms of
information. We are currently developing machine learning methods, to be trained and tested on
the annotated corpus, that would allow for the automatic categorization of biomedical text along
the general dimensions that we have presented. The guidelines in full detail, along with annotated
examples, are publicly available.
