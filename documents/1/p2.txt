Results: We have identified five qualitative dimensions that we believe characterize a broad range
of scientific sentences, and are therefore useful for supporting a general approach to text-mining:
focus, polarity, certainty, evidence, and directionality. We define these dimensions and describe the
guidelines we have developed for annotating text with regard to them.
