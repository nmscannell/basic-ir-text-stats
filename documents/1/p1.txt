Background: While biomedical text mining is emerging as an important research area, practical
results have proven difficult to achieve. We believe that an important first step towards more
accurate text-mining lies in the ability to identify and characterize text that satisfies various types
of information needs. We report here the results of our inquiry into properties of scientific text
that have sufficient generality to transcend the confines of a narrow subject area, while supporting
practical mining of text for factual information. Our ultimate goal is to annotate a significant corpus
of biomedical text and train machine learning methods to automatically categorize such text along
certain dimensions that we have defined.
