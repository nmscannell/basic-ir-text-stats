Text is the predominant medium for
information exchange among experts.
The volume of biomedical literature is
increasing at such a rate that it is difficult
to efficiently locate, retrieve and manage
relevant information without the use of
text-mining applications. In order
to share the vast amounts of biomedical
knowledge effectively, textual evidence
needs to be linked to ontologies as the
main repositories of formally represented
knowledge. Ontologies are conceptual
models that aim to support consistent and
unambiguous knowledge sharing and that
provide a framework for knowledge
integration. An ontology links concept
labels to their interpretations, ie
specifications of their meanings including
concept definitions and relations to other
concepts. Apart from relations such as isa
and part-of, generally present in almost
any domain, ontologies also model
domain-specific relations, eg has-location,
clinically-associated-with and hasmanifestation
are relations specific for the
biomedical domain. Therefore, ontologies
reflect the structure of the domain and
constrain the potential interpretations of
terms.
