How Safe is Safe Enough?  Quantifying Radiation Damage

The main focus of JSC’s Radiation Biophysics Laboratory is to conduct fundamental research to expand the
knowledge base and reduce the uncertainty in health risks from exposure to space radiation. In addition,
computer models and computational tools are being developed to assist in the projection of astronauts’ risk
of cancer and acute radiation syndrome. Scientists associated with the Human Research Program (HRP) conduct
ground based studies using an accelerator-based simulation of space radiation at the NASA Space Radiation
Laboratory (NSRL) facilities at Brookhaven, NY. Biological samples are irradiated at these facilities and
transported back to the laboratory for analysis at the molecular and cellular level. Results of these studies
are used to understand the biological effects of space radiation, guide future studies and validate the output
of the computational models.

Technology and Hardware used to analyze cellular and molecular changes include:

    Fluorescent microscopes
    Tissue culture facilities
    Flow cytometry equipment
    Cytogenetic image and analysis equipment
    Radiobiological data
    Radiation projection models
    Computational tools to assess and project crew risk of cancer and acute radiation syndrome from space radiation
