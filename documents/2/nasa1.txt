Spacewalks, also known as Extravehicular Activities or EVAs, are an important aspect of space exploration.
The Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) that crewmembers wear provides life support, atmospheric containment,
thermal insulation, cooling, solar radiation protection and Micrometeroroid/Orbital Debris (MMOD) protection during
an EVA. One medical condition that can occur during a spacewalk is Decompression Sickness (DCS). Spaceflight DCS
is the result of inadequate denitrogenation prior to an EVA. The EMU is maintained at a significantly lower pressure
than the ambient pressure of the International Space Station (ISS). To prevent DCS, astronauts pre-breathe 100%
Oxygen (O2) to displace Nitrogen (N2) in their tissues. This pre-breathe prevents the formation of N2 gas bubbles,
which can cause localized joint pain, or, in the worst cases, severe cardiopulmonary and neurologic symptoms.

The Human Health and Performance (HH&P) Directorate's EVA Physiology team conducts research to develop pre-breathe
protocols with shorter preparation time while reducing or preventing DCS. EVA Physiology scientists and engineers
develop and test the protocols, support crew training, and develop standards that are included in the NASA Standard
3001 Volume 1, Crew Health Standards.
