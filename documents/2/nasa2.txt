Preparing Astronauts for Spacewalks

The EVA Physiology team provides operations support for EVAs conducted by astronauts aboard the ISS.
Astronauts are trained using individualized exercise prescriptions for the In-Suit Light Exercise (ISLE)
pre-breathe protocol. Suited metabolic rate characterizations are completed during EVA training in the Neutral
Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) pool. Scientists and engineers also perform suit and life support system hardware
development and testing, including evaluations of suit ventilation for carbon dioxide washout, metabolic rate
measurement for suited evaluations and integrated testing of the portable life support system.
