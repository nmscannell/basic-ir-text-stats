Protecting Against the Unseen

Radiation exposure incurred during space exploration is one of the greatest threats to an astronautâ€™s health.
The associated risks include, carcinogenesis, degenerative tissue effects, central nervous system effects, and
acute radiation syndromes. The radiation environment outside of Earth's protective atmosphere is comprised of
energetic protons and heavy nuclei that pose a hazard to living organisms. The damage caused by energetic nuclei
has been shown to produce distinct biological damage compared with radiation on Earth, leading to large
uncertainties in the projection of health risks and obscuring evaluation of the effectiveness of possible
radiation countermeasures. Although information exists to recommend crew exposure limits and spacecraft design
requirements for missions in low Earth orbit, there is insufficient knowledge of the health effects of space
radiation and the space radiation environment to provide recommendations on crew exposure limits and design
requirements for long-duration missions.
